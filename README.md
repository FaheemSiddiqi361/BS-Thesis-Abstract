Abstractâ€”This paper presents a novel inverter topology. A
four-level inverter design is presented. A circuit topology is
implemented that requires a single isolation supply for gate
drive of all drive MOSFETs. The drive sequences are
multilevel counter parts of binary programmed pulse width
modulation, in that the set of integral values for voltage input
to inverter circuit has four members rather than two as in the
case of binary. These sequences are optimized using mixed
integral linear programming tool of Matlab. The resulting
sequences are tested on circuit of inverter in Pspice using SPLS
interface. The harmonic contents comparison of the proposed
technique is performed with its binary counterpart inverter,
which confirms the performance superiority of the presented
technique.
